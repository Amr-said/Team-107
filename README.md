## Project Description
- There is a pressing need for an automated solution that can accurately and efficiently detect and classify different types of Retinal OCT diseases.

## Goal
- Our goal is to develop a deep learning model to automatically detect and classify different types of Retinal OCT diseases

## Repository Structure
Explain the structure of your repository and where to find important files. For example:
- `main.py`: This is the main entry point for the project and handles object-oriented programming (OOP) deployment.
- `model-copy`: This is the file contains Deep_learning model-related dunctions (OOP).
- `working_application2.py`: This script is responsible for running the working model of the application.
- `my_model.h5`: This file contains the trained model. Note that we didn't train the model due to resource constraints.
- `finalcode.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains our work, experiments, and project documentation.

## Getting Started
- with working model deployment you can run the command streamlit run working_application (2).py
